# DiscoUltimate & DiscoUtlimate v2 TMC - Klipper Config

**!!! Work in Progress !!!**

The purpose of this repository is to build a klipper config for the DiscoUltimate & DiscoUltimate v2 TMC.  
The repository is supervised by Dagoma but the main contributions come from the community.  

**Dagoma do not take any responsibility for this code. They aren't responsible of any issues or damages which may occur. Use at your own risk.**

## Hardware

The DiscoUltimate uses the F5 Dagoma motherboard and the DiscoUltimate v2 TMC uses the D6 Dagoma motherboard.  
The main evolution from the F5 to the D6 is the use of TMC2209 drivers instead of A5984 drivers.
