# DiscoUltimate & DiscoUtlimate v2 TMC - Klipper Config

**!!! Work in Progress !!!**

The purpose of this repository is to build a klipper config for the DiscoUltimate & DiscoUltimate v2 TMC.  
The repository is supervised by Dagoma but the main contributions come from the community.  

## Hardware

### Motherboard

The DiscoUltimate uses the F5 Dagoma motherboard and the DiscoUltimate v2 TMC uses the D6 Dagoma motherboard.  
The main evolution from the F5 to the D6 is the use of TMC2209 drivers instead of A5984 drivers.  

### Z-probe

The default Z-probe of both DiscoUltimate and DiscoUltimate v2 TMC is an inductive sensor.  
As we are customizing our printers, we can also use a capacitive sensor or a BLTouch instead. So we're gonna add these multiple options to the config.  

## Software

Currently, we are trying to replicate Marlin program behavior of the DiscoUltimate.  

## Contributors

Initially, the idea of a Klipper config for Dagoma's printer was presented by [@cygauvan](https://github.com/cygauvan) and [@Squalthor](https://github.com/Squalthor). [@0r31](https://github.com/0r31) and [@TheRaf974](https://github.com/TheRaf974) have contributed with there knowledge of the printers.
